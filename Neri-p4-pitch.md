# Project 4

### App details
**bbBook**: for all of baby's precious milestones
Developer: Neri Ramirez
New Technology: Vue.js (MEVN stack if time allows)

### How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
I plan on spending a few hours going through the Vue.js video course to learn the basics. I will also research other libraries and APIs that I can incorporate to add features with minimal lift.

### What is your goal with this project?
I wish to create a beautiful and functional product that is user-friendly and showcases the main subject: babies! Users will be able to keep track of baby's milestones and memories, all in one place. 

### Who is the user for your app?
Parents and caregivers of babies 

### Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
I forsee having trouble with authentication since I would like my users to be able to create an account and login to store their data.
